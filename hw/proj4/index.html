    <h2>
      [Auto]Stitching Photo Mosaics<br />
      <b>Due Date: This project has two parts. See below.</b>
    </h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This project is all about stitching together many photographs to create
      larger composite images. It is divided into two parts
      <b>with two separate due dates</b> (see 'Deliverables'):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the first part, you will capture source photographs, define
        correspondences between them, and then warp and composite them. A
        detailed description of the requirements and scoring is given
        <a href="partA.html">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the second part, you will automate the correspondence-finding portion
        of Part 1 so that you can create the panoramas automatically. A detailed
        description of the requirements and scoring for this part are given
        <a href="partB.html">here</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <p>Since this is an multi-part project, there are several due dates:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b style="color: red"> Oct. 16 2024</b>: code and project webpage for
        the <a href="partA.html">first part</a> should be complete and submitted
        to gradescope. Late days will be counted the usual way. If you turn in
        the first part late, late days will be used.
        <!-- If you need to turn this in late, email course staff so we can grab a copy. -->
      </li>
      <li>
        <b style="color: red"> Oct. 29 2024</b>: code and results from the
        <a href="partB.html">second part</a> are due, along with any bells and
        whistles. <b>Note:</b> Webpage for the second part should use the same
        webpage as the first part; you can simply append your results for the
        second part, so results from both parts are included in the submitted
        page.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Submission</h3>
    <p>
      Upload your assignment as usual as instructed
      <a href="../submitting.html">here</a>
