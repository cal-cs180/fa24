    <h1>How to submit assignments for CS180 (CS280A).</h1>
    <p>
      For each assignment, you will be required to submit two deliverables to
      Gradescope (Entry Code:  KZNDRJ):
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. Your code:</strong></p>
    <p>
      For every assignment you should create a main.py, or main.ipynb, or main.m
      that can be used to run all your code for the assignment, and a README.txt
      file that contains the descriptions of each code file, your name, SID,
      school email, and the link to your web page submission. Submit all source
      code used to generate your results, as well as the README.txt file. Please
      be sure to appropriately comment your code so that the graders can
      appropriately identify where your implementations lie and what they do.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Your webpage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make sure that your main report page is called <tt>index.html</tt> so
        browsers open it automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure that you include all the images that are referenced from your
        report in your zip file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remember<strong> not to use any absolute links</strong> to images etc,
        as these will not work online. Only use relative links.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zip up all your files and images, as well as the code and README.txt to
        one zip file. You may put the code under a folder named code, alongside
        the index.html.
      </li>
      <li>
        The top (zipped) folder should include your index.html file. Do not add
        any additional directories between the zipped folder and the index page,
        as this will cause your website to be displayed incorrectly. Please
        verify that when you unzip the submitted file, you can find the
        index.html right away.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have problems with images not appearing on your page, check that
        the permissions are correct and the filenames match your html files
        (e.g. .JPG vs .jpeg).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are submitting the notebook file, make sure you clean the cell
        outputs before submitting it. If you keep those intermediate
        visualizations in the notebook it can easily become dozens of MB but
        with only the code you should expect it to be less than 1MB.
      </li>
      <li>
        For all your images shown on the web page, please save them into ".jpg"
        or ".jpeg" format. You should expect hundreds of KB for a image in jpg
        format (it's a compression format), but it can be dozens of MB in png
        format. They look visually the same so you should always use jpg for web
        page. And it's also recommended to only put medium-size (less than 1k
        resolution) images on the web page so your total file size would not hit
        the submission limit (100MB)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Suggested File structure:</strong></p>
    submission.zip<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|-README.txt<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|-index.html<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|-images/<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|----result1.jpg<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|----result2.jpg<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|-code/<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|---main.ipynb <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|---lib.py

    <h1>Labs Available<br /></h1>
    <p>
      Matlab is available on all of the Instructional UNIX and Windows<br />
      computers. All students enrolled students can get accounts<br />
      on EECS computers. Students can use any of the the labs in<br />
      Soda (UNIX) as well as 199 Cory (Windows). EECS also has login servers.
