  <h1>How to submit assignments for CS180/CS280A.</h1>
  <p>
    For each assignment, you will be required to submit two deliverables to
    Gradescope (Entry Code: KZNDRJ). <br>
    Please upload a <code>.zip</code> adhering to the following structure:
  </p>
  <code>
    submission.zip<br />
    ├─code/<br />
    │ ├─main.ipynb <br />
    │ ├─lib.py<br />
    │ └─README.txt<br />
    └─web/<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;├─page.pdf <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;└─sites.txt <br />
  </code>

  <br>
  <h1>1. Code</code></h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All of your project code should be contained in some
      <code>main.py</code>/<code>main.ipynb</code>/<code>main.m</code> that the grader(s) can run to reproduce your
      results. If you have a complex workflow, make sure to upload all the necessary files and include a
      <code>README.txt</code> file describing how we can run your code.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please be sure to appropriately comment your code so that the graders can appropriately identify where your
      implementations lie and what they do.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place all of your coding files in the <code>code/</code> directory. They should be distinct from your web files.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <h1>2. Webpage Report</h1>
  <p>
    If you do not already have a webpage set up, we recommend using GitHub Pages (<a href="./gh-pages.html">tutorial</a>).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You should upload a <code>web/</code> folder containing two files: <code>page.pdf</code> and <code>sites.txt</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>page.pdf</code> should be a PDF of your webpage (i.e. printing the page and saving it as a PDF). If your page contains animations/interactivity that cannot be captured in a PDF, please note this in the report.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>sites.txt</code> should be a have two lines (and nothing else!):
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Webpage report URL (i.e. <code>https://[gh-user].github.io/[proj#]/</code> or <code>https://[gh-user].github.io/[repo-name]/[proj#]/</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        GitHub repo URL (i.e. <code>https://github.com/[gh-user].github.io/</code> or <code>https://github.com/[gh-user]/[repo-name]/</code>) ─ <b>this must be a public repo!</b>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>


  <ul>
    <!-- <li>
      Make sure that your main report page is called <tt>index.html</tt> so
      browsers open it automatically.
    </li> -->
    <!-- <li>
      Make sure that you include all the images that are referenced from your
      report in your zip file.
    </li> -->
    <!-- <li>
      Remember<strong> not to use any absolute links</strong> to images etc,
      as these will not work online. Only use relative links.
    </li> -->
    <!-- <li>
      Zip up all your files and images, as well as the code and README.txt to
      one zip file. You may put the code under a folder named code, alongside
      the index.html.
    </li> -->
    <!-- <li>
      The top (zipped) folder should include your index.html file. Do not add
      any additional directories between the zipped folder and the index page,
      as this will cause your website to be displayed incorrectly. Please
      verify that when you unzip the submitted file, you can find the
      index.html right away.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have problems with images not appearing on your page, check that
      the permissions are correct and the filenames match your html files
      (e.g. .JPG vs .jpeg).
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are submitting the notebook file, make sure you clean the cell
      outputs before submitting it. If you keep those intermediate
      visualizations in the notebook it can easily become dozens of MB but
      with only the code you should expect it to be less than 1MB.
    </li>
    <li>
      For all your images shown on the web page, please save them into ".jpg"
      or ".jpeg" format. You should expect hundreds of KB for a image in jpg
      format (it's a compression format), but it can be dozens of MB in png
      format. They look visually the same so you should always use jpg for web
      page. And it's also recommended to only put medium-size (less than 1k
      resolution) images on the web page so your total file size would not hit
      the submission limit (100MB)
    </li> -->
  </ul>

  <!-- <h1>Labs Available<br /></h1>
  <p>
    Matlab is available on all of the Instructional UNIX and Windows<br />
    computers. All students enrolled students can get accounts<br />
    on EECS computers. Students can use any of the the labs in<br />
    Soda (UNIX) as well as 199 Cory (Windows). EECS also has login servers.
